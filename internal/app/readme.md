# APP package

TODO

Explain what it is. 

Mix of domain and application logic - for simplicity. We could split this further - separate clean domain.

## Errors

TODO

Explain custom errors, how do they help and the helper methods for them. 

Ben has a [good post about errors](https://www.gobeyond.dev/failure-is-your-domain/), and our `errors.go` file is exactly what he describes as "application role errors".
